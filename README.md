# Matrix-Multiplication
A matrix is a rectangular array or table of numbers, symbols, or expressions, arranged in rows and columns in mathematics.

Matrix multiplication is a binary operation that takes two matrices as input and produces another matrix as output. It is a way to combine the elements of two matrices to produce a new matrix.
